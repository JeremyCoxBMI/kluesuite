# Kluesuite program

## Java Version
Kluesuite runs on Oracle Java 1.8.  We have seen other JVM's give erroneous errors, so Oracle Java is required.

Once Oracle 1.8 JDK is installed, you only need to download kluesuite.jar containing the programs and other helper scripts contained in the Release zip file.

Alternatively, Zulu Java 1.8 has been stable on some systems and has superior garbage collection by using a separate process that is online with Java.  This can increase performance in some circumstances.

## Executables

Tentative
